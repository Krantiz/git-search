## Steps to set up the server.

To run this application in local:
- Clone the project
- Run command ``` npm install ``` to load all the packages
- Spin the angular server using ``` ng serve ``` (Note: Make sure you have ng cli installed globally)
- Now open localhost:4200 in browser to see the application running

## Assumptions and Explanations
- I have not used any routing and kept the functionality as simple as possible
- Tried level best to acheive the good UI in limited time
- I have not destroyed the subscription (Realized while submitting the code so mentioning it over here.)
- It is not the best optimised code but I can improve it if more time is given.


## UnitTest Cases
- Listed few unit test cases in the file (unit-test-cases.txt) in the root folder. (https://github.com/Krantiz/git-search/blob/main/unit-test-cases.txt)
